# Mac Android Mobile Screen
Screen android phone to mac 

Yes, you *can* use your Mac laptop screen to view (and even control) your Android phone for things like watching movies or gaming. There are several methods to do this, depending on what you want to achieve — simple screen mirroring, interactive control, or low-latency gaming. Here are the best options:

---

### ✅ **Option 1: Scrcpy (Best Free Solution for Control + Viewing)**
- **What it does:** Mirrors your Android screen to your Mac via USB or Wi-Fi, and lets you control it with your keyboard/mouse.
- **Use case:** Great for gaming, app control, and streaming media.
- **Latency:** Very low, suitable for gaming.
- **Price:** Free and open-source.
- **Requirements:**
  - Enable **USB Debugging** in Android Developer Options.
  - Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on your Mac (if not already installed).
  - Then run in Terminal:
    ```bash
    brew install scrcpy
    ```
✅ Step 1: Install ADB via Homebrew

In your Mac Terminal, run the following command:
```
brew install android-platform-tools
```
This installs ADB and adds it to your PATH.

✅ Step 2: Verify ADB Installation

Once it's installed, confirm ADB is working by running:
```
adb devices
```
You should see your Android device listed. If it says “unauthorized,” check your phone and accept the USB debugging prompt.

✅ Step 3: Run Scrcpy Again

Now that ADB is set up, simply run:
It should now mirror your Android screen on your Mac.

  - Connect your Android phone via USB and run:
    ```bash
    scrcpy
    ```
